# Beetroot
Beat syncing utility
(in development)

# Usage
`beatSync.py` Is used to create a .data file for an audio file describing the bpm and offsets.
`danceVideo.py` Is used to generate a "Bouncing effect" on desired video/image file with a pre-picked audio file.

## Modes
- bpm:  bounce the video based on an already generated .data file
- loud: bounce the video based on the loudness levels of the bass frequencies 

# Note
This project is still in development and has been partially abandoned. There may be features not working or missing. Any contributions will be greatly appreciated!
